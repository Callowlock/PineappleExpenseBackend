<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on preprocessing receipt images to enhance text extraction quality. The pipeline is designed to improve image clarity and contrast before running OCR or text extraction techniques. Tesseract OCR was dropped in favor of AWS Textract, and the final text extraction pipeline is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/ReceiptProcessing">ReceiptProcessing</a> repository.</p>
